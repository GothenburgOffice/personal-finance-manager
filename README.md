# Personal Finance Manager
App for managing diversified investments and tracking personal net worth.

This is my first solo project in Node.js, Express, MongoDB and written for educational purposes and personal use.

The large portfolio apps do not support regular bank accounts, credits, accumulated dividend payments, taxes, bullion, crypto-assets or unlisted stocks. This app uses free APIs were possible, but most things will have to be updated manually.
